		<p class="genbig">WHAT IS DIABLO 1 HD ?</p>
		<p class="gensmall">Overview</p>
		<p class="content">Diablo 1 HD is an unofficial modification, for the original Diablo game without the Hellfire expansion, so far. It modifies the game by enhancing resolution, adding new playable classes and skills, improving items and monsters, and enabling unused quests and items.
		<p class="gensmall">So is this a cheat?</p>
		<p class="content">Mods are not cheats. A cheat makes the game easier. Diablo 1 HD keeps the original game's atmosphere while revitalizing it.</p>

		<p class="gensmall">Features</p>

		<p class="content"><b>o Changed UI and massive core improvements.</b><br />
				Like widescreen resolution, advanced NPC screen, 50 pages in Personal stash and 10 pages in Shared stash of 10x10 size,
				telepad waypoints to even number dungeon levels, better gambling system through Gheed NPC, belts with up to 25 slots, and many more.
		<p class="content"><b>o 6 Character Classes, each with unique skills.</b><br />
				Bored with using just Spells in combat? Diablo 1 HD introduces brand new skill trees for each class with 5 skills that will unlock and improve as you level up. You always wanted to play as a 
				stealthy Assassin? Or maybe a summoner Necromancer? Now you can!
		<p class="content"><b>o A Spell Book with 6 pages to accommodate all spells.</b><br />
				Spells were tweaked and balanced and the Spell Book now features 6 pages holding a total of 38 spells that can be studied up to level 15 by reading spellbooks.
				And all spells are available for learning, like Nova, Apocalypse and 6 brand new cold based spells.
		<p class="content"><b>o New base items and 2 tiers for all item types.</b><br />
				Diablo 1 HD features new item types, like belts and refurbishes old ones. Additionally, each playable class benefits from higher 
				speed while using certain weapons. Want to upgrade a weapon or an armor to its upper tier? You can if you find and learn certain recipes.
		<p class="content"><b>o Better magical and rare items. That's right RARE items!</b><br />
				Between the improved affix pool and the addition of powerful new affixes including "-% Target Resistance", rares
				are now a solid option in game. So are magic items useless? No, just like most item types you can salvage them and obtain an array of materials.
		<p class="content"><b>o Crafting, as if you haven't figured it out yet.</b><br />
				What more could you ask for? Thanks to a revolutionary system you can now craft specific items,
				granted you have salvaged enough materials from other items and have found recipes. With over 230 recipes, you will never run out of options to better your equipment.
		<p class="content"><b>o An assortment of new uniques and even sets.</b><br />
				While playing Diablo 1 HD you can come across over 200 uniques and more than 30 new sets, some of which have special affixes. Not excited yet?
				Wait till you see some of the morphing abilities granted by equipping certain items you will find. Gotta catch 'em all!
		<p class="content"><b>o Challenging Boss and Elite monsters types.</b><br />
				If the normal monsters are manageable, the Boss and Elite monsters will have you walk for your life. Featuring several random modifiers like Behemoth, Haste, Charge and many others,
				Boss and Elite monsters are worthy opponents for the strongest heroes.
		<p class="content"><b>o A total of 25 quests, all available in all games.</b><br />
				Of course all the new quest also have spoken dialog, pulled from unused files in the original game. So go and explore 7 new unique levels, solve different puzzles and face fierce foes.
				Seriously, right now you could be playing Diablo 1 HD and not just reading about it.
