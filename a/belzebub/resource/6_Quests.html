		<p class="genbig">QUESTS</p>
		<p class="content">As you probably know, quests in the original Diablo game are randomized, being set into groups and 1 from each group is always left out, thus you are always served only some of the quests. Now forget about that, Diablo 1 HD will treat you to all quests in any game you play, and on top of this it resurrects most of the unused ones that didn't make the retail version and were buried in the game files.</p>
